# Own Your Mind
Own Your Mind is an organization dedicated to teaching people that they can
change things they think should be improved, whether small or large, that they
are allowed, and in fact ar encouraged to question things, and that, once
questioned, they can find solutions and improvements themselves. This is how the
world works. This is how we discovered all of modern science, how organizations
are build, how countries are run. One day, someone questioned, and then made a
change.

### The Site
The website is basic. At the moment it hosts nothing more than an explanation of
what we do.
